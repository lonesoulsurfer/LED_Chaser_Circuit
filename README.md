The circuit was put together to add some life to a little Junkbot I made from a vintage shaver and umbrella!

The circuit is your classic ' Knight Rider' style LED chaser.  The LED's move left to right and the speed is controlled via a light dependent resistor - the darker it is the slower the LED move.
